# Developer Brief: AI Realty Assistant

## Project Overview

Build a SaaS platform for real estate professionals that allows them to submit property details via WhatsApp or a mobile app, generate website listings and social media posts using AI, and manage content across multiple platforms. The system should support tiered subscription plans with feature gating, multi-tenant architecture, and modular components for future expansion.

## User Stories

### 1. Property Submission

As an agent, I want to send property details and photos via WhatsApp so that the AI can create a draft property listing for my website.

As an agent, I want to submit property details through a mobile app so I can manage listings without using WhatsApp.

- Draft property page generated automatically in CMS.
- User receives notification when draft is ready.
- User can approve, edit, or reject draft before publishing.

### 4. Subscription Plans

As an admin, I want to enable or disable features based on the user’s plan so that higher-tier plans receive additional functionality.

- Feature gating middleware prevents unauthorized access to higher-tier modules.

### 5. CRM & Payment Management (Business & Enterprise Plans)

Acceptance Criteria:

- CRM tracks leads, assigns agents, and logs interactions.
